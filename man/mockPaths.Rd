\usage{
db_mock_paths(new)

.db_mock_paths(new)
}
\arguments{
\item{new}{Either a character vector of path(s) to add, or \code{NULL} to reset
to the default.}
}
\value{
If \code{new} is omitted, the function returns the current search paths, a
character vector. If \code{new} is provided, the updated value will be returned
invisibly.
}
\description{
By default, \code{with_mock_api} will look for mocks relative to the current
working directory (or the test directory). If you want to look in other
places, you can call \code{db_mock_paths} to add directories to the search path.
}
\details{
It works like \code{\link[base:.libPaths]{base::.libPaths()}}: any directories you specify will be added
to the list and searched first. The default directory will be searched last.
Only unique values are kept: if you provide a path that is already found in
\code{db_mock_paths}, the result effectively moves that path to the first
position.

For finer-grained control, or to completely override the default behavior
of searching in the current working directory, you can set the option
"dittodb.mock.paths" directly.

This function is similar to \code{.mockPaths()} from
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httptest}{httptest}

The function \code{.db_mock_paths} is the same as \code{db_mock_paths} although it is
deprecated and should not be used.
