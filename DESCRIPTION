Description: Testing and documenting code that communicates with remote
  databases can be painful. Although the interaction with R is usually relatively 
  simple (e.g. data(frames) passed to and from the server), because they rely on 
  a separate service and the data there, testing them can be difficult to set up,
  unsustainable in a CI environment, or impossible without replicating an entire
  production cluster. This package fixes that by allowing you to make recordings
  from your database interactions and then play them back while testing (or in
  other contexts) all without needing to spin up or have access to the database
  your code would typically connect to.
